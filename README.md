## Abstract

* \textcolor{blue}{This article comprises the applied problem of the Decision Theory course from the department of Systems Engineering of UFMG taught by Professor Lucas Batista. The objective of this work is to apply the optmization and decision techniques taught throughout the semester. The proposed problem aims to minimize the number of access points routers to supply the Mbps consumption demanded by clients in a controlled environment. Also meeting pre-established optimization restrictions.}
